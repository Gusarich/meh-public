  "description": "MEH Pass is a collection of 777 NFTs that grants access to the $MEH community's private chat and other special privileges in the near future. This collection includes 258 diamond NFTs, awarded to individuals from the blockchain snapshot who hold over 1,000,000 $MEH in their wallets, and 519 default NFTs. There is no difference in utility between the diamond and default NFTs; they simply serve as a gesture of gratitude for the OG $MEH holders.",
